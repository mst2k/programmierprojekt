## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the application is using Docker.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5174:5174 --name orsolver mastrohm/orsolver
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:5174`

### Local Installation

Alternatively, you can run the application locally. Please refer to the [Development](#development) section for more details.


## Usage

To use the OR Solver:

1. Select the problem type (General, Transport, Knapsack, Shift Plan)
2. Choose a solver (GLPKHgourvest, GLPKJavil, Highs)
3. Input your problem in GMPL, LP, or MPS format
4. Click "Solve" to get results

## Performance Testing

We have implemented local performance tests to compare the efficiency of three open-source solver libraries (in JavaScript and WebAssembly formats) against their native counterparts. These tests help us evaluate the performance trade-offs of using web-based solver implementations.

Key aspects of our performance testing:
- Compares three solver libraries:
  - [GLPKHgourvest](https://github.com/hgourvest/glpk.js) (JavaScript)
  - [GLPKJavil](https://github.com/jvail/glpk.js/) (WebAssembly) 
  - [Highs](https://github.com/lovasoa/highs-js) (WebAssembly)
- Tests both JavaScript and WebAssembly (WASM) versions against native solver installations
- Evaluates performance across different problem types and sizes

For detailed information on how to run these tests and interpret the results, please refer to our [Performance Testing Guide](./performanceLocal/README.md).

These tests are crucial for:
- Quantifying the performance impact of using web-based solver libraries
- Understanding the trade-offs between different solver implementations
- Helping users make informed decisions about which solver to use for their specific needs

We encourage users and contributors to review these performance results and contribute to our testing efforts, helping us provide accurate performance insights for the OR community.

## Development

To setup the development environment, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mst2k/programmierprojekt.git
   ```

2. Change to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173/`

## Testing

Our project employs two types of tests to ensure code quality and functionality:

1. Unit Tests: For individual functions and methods
2. End-to-End (E2E) Tests: For full application workflows

Ensuring all tests pass before submitting a pull request is crucial for maintaining project stability.

#### Unit Tests

We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.

To run unit tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

To generate a coverage report:
```bash
npm run coverage
```

#### E2E Tests

We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E testing.

To run E2E tests:
```bash
npm run test-ct
```

To view the test report in your browser:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during testing:

- check if you are in the correct directory (`frontend`)

- Check the CLI output for specific error messages

- Consult the documentation of the testing libraries for more information:
   - [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/)
   - [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components)

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

#### Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline runs all tests automatically for each pull request. Check the CI status and address any failures before requesting a review.

If you need assistance with testing or have questions about our testing strategy, don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers.
